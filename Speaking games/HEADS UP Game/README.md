## Plan

**1**. Ask your students what TV shows they like watching. You may ask them to work in pairs and after that hold a plenary discussion.

**2**. Tell your students that you are going to watch an episode of one popular American TV show. Ask them if they know [**Ellen TV show**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_Show)
or any other similar show in their county.

**3**. Ask your students to watch the TV show and make notes about the game.

**4**. Play the video once or twice. For instance, [**Ellen's New Game, 'Heads Up!'**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO_ezpX7DwY)

**5**. Let your students tell you about the rules and write them down if necessary.

**6**. Tell your students that you are going to play the same game. Give them the cards (included in [**PDF**](./HandsUpGame.pdf)). Every student should take one card, hold it above their heads. Others should try to explain what person their groupmates have.
